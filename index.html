<p>You already know Transmit is a wonderful file transfer app, maybe even the best on any platform. It&#8217;s jammed with features, it&#8217;s fast,  it supports every major cloud storage provider, and it looks awfully nice.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s something you might not know: the reasons we never put Transmit 5 in the App Store. They&#8217;re simple. We weren&#8217;t sure we could provide a good-enough  Transmit experience under the stringent sandboxing security  the App Store requires. And frankly, we weren&#8217;t sure Apple cared that much about the App Store on the Mac. </p>



<p>Since then, a lot has changed. macOS Mojave gave us a significantly improved App Store  that caters to professionals like yourself and seems to treat  apps with respect. And sandboxing has evolved enough that Transmit can be nearly feature-parity with its non-sandboxed cousin.</p>



<p>So, as we promised at WWDC: it was time to give this another go.</p>



<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-5/id1436522307">You can now get Transmit 5 on the Mac App Store!</a></p>



<p>But, there&#8217;s a twistâ€¦</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-14-11.19.34.png" alt="A screenshot of Transmit in the Mac App Store." class="wp-image-8505 jetpack-lazy-image" data-lazy-src="https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-14-11.19.34.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img src="https://panic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-14-11.19.34.png" alt="A screenshot of Transmit in the Mac App Store." class="wp-image-8505"/></noscript></figure>



<h2>The Twist</h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-light-purple-color">Transmit from the Mac App Store is a subscription â€” <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-5/id1436522307">just $24.99 a year.</a></strong> Included with your subscription is Transmit, access to Panic Sync, and any major Transmit updates that we may release in the future, all rolled into a convenient yearly charge. There&#8217;s even a free 7-day trial before your subscription kicks in. And, of course, you can cancel at any time.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like subscriptions, don&#8217;t worry! <strong>You can still buy Transmit 5 directly from us. <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">It&#8217;s still $45.</a></strong> It will still include free minor updates. And you get the same support as a subscriber would.</p>



<p><strong>The choice is yours.</strong> Love the App Store? Subscribe today. Don&#8217;t like subscriptions? Buy it directly from us. Everybody wins! (Almost.)</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a little something in it for us, too â€” a chance to learn about the subscription business and see how, if at all, it can impact our decisions moving forward.</p>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<p><strong>Wait, so I have to subscribe to Transmit now?</strong><br>No, my post-skimming friend, you don&#8217;t. While Transmit in the App Store is a subscription,  <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">you can still buy Transmit 5 directly from us</a> at full price and own it forever for just $45.<br></p>



<p><strong>How much does the subscription cost?</strong><br>$24.99 a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Is there a free trial?</strong><br>Absolutely. When you install Transmit from the App Store, on first launch you&#8217;re given 7 days to use it as much as you want, without restriction, until the subscription  kicks in, and you can cancel during the trial (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">here</a>) if it doesn&#8217;t work for you. It&#8217;s really simple and should give you more than enough time to demo the app and make sure you love it.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s included with the subscription?</strong><br>Transmit, Panic Sync, and frequent  updates, of course. But you&#8217;ll also automatically get any <em>major</em> updates we release in the future as long as you remain subscribed.</p>



<p><strong>I already bought Transmit 5. Can I switch to the App Store version?</strong><br>If you bought Transmit 5 in the last 60 days, we can refund your  purchase if you&#8217;d like to subscribe instead. Simply <a href="mailto:support@panic.com?subject=Transmit%20Refund%20For%20App%20Store">e-mail our support team.</a> Beyond that, it&#8217;s gets really difficult, particularly as the prices are so different.</p>



<p><strong>Hey, what if I love the App Store but strongly dislike subscriptions?</strong><br>Yeah, that&#8217;s the one bummer zone in our plan â€”  we&#8217;re sorry. But we believe the App Store is suited particularly well for subscriptions, and we&#8217;re always looking for a sustainable future  building our complex applications.</p>



<p><strong>Does it have the same features as regular Transmit 5?</strong><br>Yes, it does! With one small exception â€” &#8220;Open in Terminal&#8221; depends on AppleScripting the terminal, which isn&#8217;t possible with sandboxing (yet). But even viewing or editing or changing the permissions of files you don&#8217;t own is now possible, which wasn&#8217;t until very recently.</p>



<p><strong>What about Transmit Disk?</strong><br>It&#8217;s not in this initial release, but stay tuned.</p>



<p><strong>Any other differences in the App Store version?</strong><br>For  security, you have to manually &#8220;Choose&#8221; any local folders in the file browser that you want to navigate to. However, Transmit will remember the highest-level folder you&#8217;ve chosen, so over time you&#8217;ll have to do this less and less. (And here&#8217;s a pro-tip for all the FAQ readers out there: just drag your hard drive to the &#8220;choose a folder&#8221; view to unlock your entire drive and never be prompted again.)</p>



<p><strong>If my subscription lapses, do I lose my sites/favorites?</strong><br>Absolutely not. If you use Panic Sync, your sites are safely stored in our spacious, welcoming cloud, and you can sync them down in the future, even to non-subscription Transmit. And if you don&#8217;t use Panic Sync, as long as you don&#8217;t delete Transmit&#8217;s application support files, they&#8217;ll be there waiting for when you re-subscribe.</p>



<p><strong>Will Transmit 5 support iCloud for sync?</strong><br>We&#8217;re not planning to. We know it&#8217;s a bit of a bother to manage another account, but we really value the ability to debug syncing problems directly.</p>



<p><strong>What about Coda in the Mac App Store?</strong><br>Sadly, Coda cannot be sandboxed yet. We&#8217;re hopeful for the future.<br></p>



<p><strong>Oh and hey while I&#8217;ve got you on the line where&#8217;s Coda 3?</strong><br>ðŸ¥´ (More on Coda soon!)</p>
